# Documents Required
All McNair students are expected to complete the following: 
1. A polished and professional Curriculum Vitae (CV) that is error free. This 
version must meet the requirements of the program and is required to be a 
version of your CV that is as user-friendly-as-possible in order to be easily 
skimmed and readily understood by your potential graduate admissions 
committees.

must meet the requirements of the program, must be a statement that is written 
for one specific graduate program, and is required to be the finalized statement 
that is going to be, or has been, sent to one graduate program.    
3. A final and complete Cover Memo. This version must meet the requirements of 
the program and is to contain a complete and final list of the graduate programs 
that you successfully submitted applications to this fall. 


# Agreement
The student and their UROC instructor are to agree to a timeline and a series of one-on-one meetings that works best for the both of them. 
- All application materials are to be reviewed by the instructor and updated appropriately by the student.
- No application materials are to be submitted to any graduate program without th approval of the UROC instructor.
- All finalized materials (cover memo, personal statement, CV) are to be submitted to Dr. Huerta by Friday, November 18th. We ask that the student work with their UROC instructor consistently throughout the semester and refer to their UROC instructor as questions and concerns arise. 


# Materials
Your UROC Instructor will provide you with any lectures, assignment sheets,
and models used in the fall course as needed. The student and their instructor will work 
through these materials, address questions as they arise, and complete assignments 
based on their established timeline.
