__Application Development and Pre-Silicon Design Analysis for a Heterogeneous Computing Platform__  
*Abstract*  
<!--One liner abstract -->
As computing applications become increasingly complex and widespread, the demand for powerful and efficient computer designs has significantly increased. However, simply increasing raw processor speed renders major diminishing returns. The need to implement heterogeneous computing techniques – that is, utilizing specialized hardware that is optimized for the application at hand – is apparent. By using multiple computer architectures and hardware accelerators such as scalar processors, vector processors, and/or domain specific systems on a chip (DSSoCs) in a computer system, we can achieve performance gains beyond those that are possible with raw increases in processor speed. While execution time and power consumption characteristics are improved, this comes at the cost of a greater design complexity, requiring additional effort in hardware accelerator integration, resource management, and application development. These issues are addressed at the pre-silicon design stage in the Compiler-Integrated Extensible DSSoC Runtime (CEDR) framework. CEDR provides/combines many design features that help a hardware system designer conduct the cost-benefit analysis for different hardware implementations. The present study focuses on utilizing CEDR to implement multiple computer applications, such as a computer vision lane detection algorithm and a 5G protocol stack. This allows for analyzing how various hardware configurations affect the performance of the application. Power consumption, execution time, and scheduling characteristics are taken into consideration during the pre-silicon design stage to determine a cost-benefit analysis of implementing DSSoC hardware accelerators for these applications.
